# What's in here?
- `MBAR_estimates_cychex_LJ.py`: This script uses MBAR in order to make estimates of volume and heat of vaporization. You can call the script from the command line with the following format `python MBAR_estimates_cychex_LJ.py eps_low eps_high rmin_low rmin_high`, where the command line arguments are bounds for the state points at which you want to make new estimates. The script takes those command line arguments in order to make a grid of state points for MBAR to make estimates at. The density of this grid can be adjusted on lines 530 and 531.
